Personal Information Protection System and Query Exposure Audit Kogging
------------------------

The purpose of this library is to provide tools for protecting user information in priveleged software systems. This supports by the philosophy "Make it easy to do the right thing, make it hard to do the wrong thing.".

By using this utility library in the development of internal tools, the engineers can easily prevent themselves from being exposed to pii and other sensitive data as a matter of default course, but can then also easily log access to that data for audit trail purposes.
